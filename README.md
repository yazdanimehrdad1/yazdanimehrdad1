ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Mehrdad Yazdanibiouki
I'm a Backend Software Engineer with 3+ years of experience designing scalable microservices, building real-time APIs, and optimizing cloud-native systems. My background spans from building EVSE backend platforms at PowerFlex to developing energy analytics tools and microgrid controllers at SDG&E.

ðŸ”§ I love working with TypeScript, Python, Node.js, Redis, PostgreSQL, NATS, and cloud platforms like GCP & AWS.
ðŸš€ Iâ€™ve led performance-critical projects using OCPP/OCPI, Kubernetes, and Prometheus, and built tools that improve observability, automation, and infrastructure resilience.
âš¡ My engineering journey started in energy systems and evolved into developing backend architectures that support real-world renewable energy and EV applications.

Take a look at my repos to explore scalable service design, integration patterns, and some of my work with data-driven systems.
